                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <P>A giant panda is a large, black and white bear-like mammal native to China, known for its unique appearance and diet. They are primarily herbivorous, consuming large quantities of bamboo, but also occasionally eat other plants and animals.  </p> 
                    <P>Appearance:
                        Giant pandas have a distinctive black and white coat. Black fur covers their eyes, ears, shoulders, and legs, while the rest of their body is white. They are relatively bulky with a round head. 
                        Size:
                        Adult pandas can range from 4 to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 300 pounds. 
                        Diet:
                        Their diet consists primarily of bamboo, which they can consume up to 40 pounds a day.  </P>
                    <P>Habitat:
                        They live in mountainous regions of central China, specifically in broadleaf and coniferous forests with dense bamboo undergrowth. 
                        Behavior:
                        Giant pandas are mostly solitary animals and spend a significant amount of their time eating. They are also good climbers and swimmers. 
                        Conservation:
                        Giant pandas are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and fragmentation.   </P>
