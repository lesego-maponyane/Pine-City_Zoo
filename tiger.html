                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <P>Tigers are large, powerful cats native to Asia, known for their reddish-orange fur and distinctive black stripes. They are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain in their ecosystems, and are solitary hunters. Tigers are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and swamps.  </p> 
                    <P>Appearance:
                        Tigers are characterized by their striking orange fur with black, vertical stripes. The stripes are unique to each individual, like fingerprints. Their bodies are powerful and muscular, with large heads and paws. 
                        Habitat:
                        Tigers live in diverse habitats, including forests, grasslands, swamps, and even coastal regions. They prefer areas with dense vegetation and access to water. 
                        Diet:
                        Tigers are carnivores, meaning they primarily eat meat. They hunt large prey like deer, wild pigs, and other animals.  </P>
                    <P>Behavior:
                        Tigers are solitary hunters, typically traveling and hunting alone. They are also strong swimmers and are known for their powerful roars. 
                        Conservation Status:
                        Tigers are considered an endangered species due to habitat loss, poaching, and other threats. Conservation efforts are underway to protect tiger populations.   </P>
