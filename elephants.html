                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <P>Elephants are the largest land animals, characterized by their massive size, long trunks, tusks, and large ears. They are herbivores, primarily living in Africa and Asia, and are known for their strong family bonds and complex social structures. 
                    <P>Size and Appearance:
                        Elephants are the largest living land mammals, with males typically reaching 13 feet tall and weighing up to 7 tons, while females can be slightly smaller. They have thick, grayish-brown skin with little hair and large ears that help them regulate body temperature. 
                        Trunk:
                        The trunk, an extension of the nose and upper lip, is used for a variety of tasks, including grabbing food, drinking, and communicating. 
                        Tusks:
                        Elephants have tusks, which are long, curved t</P>
                    <P>Habitat and Diet:
                        Elephants are found in various habitats, including savannas, forests, and grasslands. They are herbivores, consuming a variety of plants, including leaves, fruits, bark, and roots. 
                        Social Structure:
                        Elephants live in tightly-knit family groups led by a matriarch. They communicate through a range of low-frequency sounds, sometimes called infrasound, which can travel for long distances. 
                        Intelligence and Behavior:
                        Elephants are known for their intelligence and complex social behaviors, including mourning the deaths of their loved ones and showing self-awareness. They also have a good sense of hearing, capable of detecting sounds from miles away. 
                        Conservation Status:
                        Many elephant populations are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and illegal ivory trade. </P>
