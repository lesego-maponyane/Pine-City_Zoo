                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <P>Gorillas are large, powerful primates with dark hair and skin, lacking hair on their faces, hands, and feet. They are the largest living primates, known for their strong chests, long arms, and short legs. Males, particularly silverbacks, are larger and heavier than females, with older males developing a silver or gray saddle on their backs. Gorillas live in social groups called troops and are primarily herbivores, feeding on plants and fruits.  </p> 
                    <P>Physical Characteristics:
                        Gorillas are robust animals with powerful bodies, broad chests, and muscular arms that are longer than their legs. They have black skin and hair, with hairless faces, hands, and feet. 
                        Size and Weight:
                        Males are significantly larger than females, reaching heights of about 1.7 meters and weights between 135-220 kg (5.5 ft and 300-485 lbs) in the wild. Captive gorillas can be much heavier. 
                        Sexual Dimorphism:
                        Male gorillas, particularly silverbacks, are much larger and heavier than females. Silverbacks are named for the silver or gray hair that develops on their backs as they age.  </P>
                    <P>Social Structure:
                        Gorillas live in social groups called troops, typically led by a silverback male. These troops can range in size from 5-10 individuals to more than 50. 
                        Habitat:
                        Gorillas inhabit the rainforests and highlands of central and eastern Africa. 
                        Diet:
                        They are primarily herbivores, consuming a variety of plants, fruits, and roots.   </P>
