                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <P>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates known for their intelligence, social behavior, and arboreal lifestyle. They are characterized by having a tail, which distinguishes them from apes. Monkeys come in various sizes and colors, and are found in a wide range of habitats across Central and South America, Africa, and Asia.  </p> 
                    <P>Primates:
                        Monkeys belong to the primate order, a group of mammals known for having opposable thumbs, grasping hands and feet, and forward-facing eyes. 
                        Tails:
                        Almost all monkeys have a tail, even if it's a small nub, which helps them distinguish them from apes, who lack tails. 
                        Arboreal Lifestyle:
                        Many monkeys are arboreal, spending much of their time in trees, using their limbs and tails for climbing and leaping.  </P>
                    <P>Social Behavior:
                        Monkeys are highly social animals, living in groups and engaging in complex communication and social interactions. 
                        Intelligence:
                        Many monkey species are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. 
                        Diet:
                        Most monkeys are omnivores, eating a variety of fruits, nuts, insects, and sometimes even small animals.  </P>
