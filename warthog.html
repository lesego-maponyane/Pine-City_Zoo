                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <P>Warthogs are distinctive African wild pigs with large, flat heads and prominent "warts" on their faces. They are known for their powerful tusks, sparse hair, and ability to dig for food. These omnivores, primarily grazers, live in family groups and are active during the day, often found near water sources.  </p> 
                    <P>Appearance:
                        Warthogs have large heads, short legs, and coarse manes down their backs. They have a long, thin tail that they hold upright when running. 
                        Distinguishing Features:
                        The most notable feature is the "wart" or fleshy bump on each side of their face, which are used for defense. 
                        Tusks:
                        Warthogs have four tusks, with the lower pair being long and sharp, used for fighting and defense.  </P>
                    <P>Diet:
                        Primarily grazers, they also eat roots, bulbs, insects, carrion, and other plants. 
                        Behavior:
                        They are diurnal animals that spend their time foraging for food and often dig in the ground. 
                        Social Structure:
                        They live in family groups, including matriarchal groups with sows and piglets, and bachelor groups. 
                        Habitat:
                        Warthogs are found in open plains, grasslands, savannahs, and woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa.   </P>
