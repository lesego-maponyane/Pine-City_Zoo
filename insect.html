                    <h3>INSECT</h3>
                    <P>Insects are small, six-legged animals with hard exoskeletons and bodies divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. They are invertebrates and belong to the class Insecta within the phylum Arthropoda. Most insects have wings, antennae, and compound eyes.  </p> 
                    <P>Exoskeleton: Insects have a hard outer covering made of chitin, which protects them. 
                        Body Structure: The three main parts of an insect's body are the head (with mouthparts, eyes, and antennae), the thorax (where legs and wings attach), and the abdomen (containing internal organs). 
                        Legs: All adult insects have six legs.  </P>
                    <P>Wings: Most insects have wings, allowing them to fly, though some are wingless. 
                        Antennae: Insects use antennae (feelers) to sense their surroundings. 
                        Eyes: Many insects have compound eyes, which provide a wide field of vision. 
                        Diversity: Insects are incredibly diverse, with millions of species described. 
                        Metamorphosis: Many insects undergo a process called metamorphosis, where they transform from a larval stage to an adult.   </P>
