                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <P>Koalas are arboreal marsupials, native to Australia, known for their thick grey fur, large round heads, and fluffy ears. They are often called "koala bears" due to their appearance, but they are more closely related to wombats and kangaroos. Koalas primarily eat eucalyptus leaves and spend most of their time resting or climbing trees.  </p> 
                    <P>Appearance:
                        Koalas have a distinctive appearance with their stout, tailless body, large head, and fluffy ears. Their fur color ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. They have a large, leathery nose and small, yellow eyes. 
                        Diet:
                        Koalas are herbivores, meaning they eat only plants, and their diet consists almost entirely of eucalyptus leaves. 
                        Habitat:
                        Koalas live in eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia.  </P>
                    <P>Behavior:
                        They are primarily arboreal, spending most of their time in trees. Koalas are solitary animals, preferring a solitary lifestyle in the wild. They are also known for their strong, clawed feet, which help them grip tree branches. 
                        Marsupials:
                        Koalas are marsupials, meaning they have a pouch where they carry their young. 
                        Conservation:
                        Koala populations have declined, and they are currently listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN.   </P>
