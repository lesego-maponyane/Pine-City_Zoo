                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <P>The gemsbok, also known as the oryx, is a large antelope native to the desert regions of Southern Africa. They are easily recognized by their long, straight horns, which can reach over a meter in length, and their striking black and white markings on their faces and legs. Gemsbok are highly adapted to the harsh desert environment, tolerating intense heat and using a unique cooling mechanism. </p> 
                    <P>Appearance:
                        Gemsbok have a tan or light brown coat with distinct black markings, including stripes on their flanks, triangular patches on their faces, and black tips on their ears. Their horns are long and pointed, and both sexes have them, though females tend to have longer horns. 
                        Adaptations:
                        Gemsbok are known for their ability to survive in arid environments, where they can go long periods without drinking water. They use a combination of strategies, including nasal panting to cool their brains and reducing water loss through perspiration. </P>
                    <P>Social Structure:
                        Gemsbok live in mixed herds, often numbering between 10 and 40 individuals. Within the herd, there is a hierarchy among both males and females. 
                        Diet:
                        They primarily graze on desert grasses and vegetation, supplementing their diet with melons and other desert plants. 
                        Size:
                        Gemsbok are large antelopes, standing up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) at the shoulder and weighing between 180-240 kilograms (400-530 pounds). 
                        Habitat:
                        They are found in a variety of desert and semi-desert habitats, including rocky plains, dunes, and dry areas with little water.  </P>
